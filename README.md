# FunctionAproximator
From the set of points (x, y, z), program reproduce the Parent function f(x, y)


# What is this?
>The function can be set in three ways:
tabularly, graphically, and by the formula.

>We can submit a function in a tabular form with a formula.
But when we have to make the opposite, there is a point when problems come in.

> The program works as follows: reads the dots in a format, processes them in a certain way, finds its original form and draw it in a window.
There, we can see how it looks like, can rotate the graph and scale it.

# How to use?
> In Executable folder there is an exe file for x86 and data folder which contains some simple tabular functions, if you wanna change func or  try on your own set of points you should change the data in a points3Dset.txt  file

> Dots written on csv format like
x1, y1, z1
....
xn, yn, zn

# What features will be in the future update?
>First of all, i will rewrite my code in a good way with all modern c++, OOP, clean code, maybe design patterns and other cool stuff.
So this task was a hard one for me, i still want to work more with Approximator, there are few problems that i wanna fix
(i want my program to be able working with functions that have z^2 component, and the other few cases)
but for now this project works and i am happy)
